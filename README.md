Included are excerpts from 3 recent Angular components I've built and are used in production.  There's also one Node project for manipulating files.  Some private or unrelated content has been removed.  

1) Node-Transform-Stream
Simple Node utility to stream a file, pass it to a transfrom to remove multiple spaces, then stream it to output (with edited file name to prevent overwriting)

2) Angular-Search-Component
An under development application for the redesign of a company website using latest generation Angular.  This is the search component with relevant files.

3) Angular-Notification-Component
A "toast" style notification pop up, can be passed custom styles, timing, and display information at callsite.

4) Angular-Modal-Component
Reusable modal window for Angular application, can include custom callback invoked when the 'Ok' button is pressed.


The top 3 other projects from my GitHub profile are probably:
1) crawler: Prototype for work, this uses Google's new Puppeteer library to crawl a single page app for server side render.  Comes with a command line or UI option (first project testing Vue.js).

2) lightr: An in progress personal project.  React with Material-UI frontend integrated with Phillips' Hue lights API.

3) j2d2-website-angular: Custom Angular v4 app integrated with Firebase for hosting and contact form storage.  Running at https://www.j2d2development.com


More front end/design oriented examples are available on my CodePen profile (https://codepen.io/joedriscoll79/).  These are generally early prototypes/playgrounds/ideas for future use.
