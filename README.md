Included are excerpts from 3 recent Angular components I've built and are used in production.  There's also one Node project for manipulating files.  Some private or unrelated content has been removed.  

1) Node-Transform-Stream
Simple Node utility to stream a file, pass it to a transfrom to remove multiple spaces, then stream it to output (with edited file name to prevent overwriting)

2) Angular-Search-Component
An under development application for the redesign of a company website using latest generation Angular.  This is the search component with relevant files.

3) Angular-Notification-Component
A "toast" style notification pop up, can be passed custom styles, timing, and display information at callsite.

4) Angular-Modal-Component
Reusable modal window for Angular application, can include custom callback invoked when the 'Ok' button is pressed.


More projects I've worked on can be found on my GitHub profile (https://github.com/J2D2Development)

The top 3 from GitHub are probably:
1) crawler: Prototype for work, this uses Google's new Puppeteer library to crawl a single page app for server side render.  Comes with a command line or UI option.  The 'vue-integration' branch is much further along and has a Vue.js frontend (https://github.com/J2D2Development/crawler/tree/vue-integration).

2) lightr: An in progress personal project.  React with Material-UI frontend integrated with Phillips' Hue lights API.

3) j2d2-website-angular: Custom Angular v4 app integrated with Firebase for hosting and contact form storage.  Running at https://www.j2d2development.com


More front end/design oriented examples are available on my CodePen profile (https://codepen.io/joedriscoll79/).  These are generally early prototypes/playgrounds/ideas for future use.
